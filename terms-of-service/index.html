Ubersales is sub-brand of Ubersales Inc. and all Ubersales brands, trademarks, logos, characters or service marks are the exclusive property of Ubersales Inc.

</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service limit Ubersales&#x2019; liability and obligations to you, grant Ubersales certain rights and allow Ubersales to change, suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services.

Your access to and use of the Services are expressly conditioned on your compliance with these Terms of Service. Ubersales reserves the right to update and change these Terms of Service from time to time without notice or acceptance by you, so please check this page frequently for updates and changes.</p>
  <p>Description of the Services. The Services are comprised of a suite of proprietary tools and applications that are designed to enable businesses to analyze, review and enhance their web and social media presence, and interact with consumers on their websites on a real-time basis. As described herein, the Services include tools that help you create content from pre-existing social media content, images and other works (collectively, &#x201C;Created Content&#x201D;) as well as analytics tools that help you measure your social media presence.</p>

YOU ARE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE SITE OR TO USE THE SERVICES (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR ACCESS OR USE IS INTENDED) IF YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>
  <p>If you accept or agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, &#x201C;you&#x201D; and &#x201C;your&#x201D; will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.</p>
